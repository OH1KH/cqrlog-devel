	    -Fix: Database upgrade routine. One comma was missed
	    -Fix: Reverted all compiler (laz 2.0) warning fixes focused to "Commandline is deprecated" because of problems
                  with process parameter settings.
                  This was quite big manual merge. I have messed up my devel-git. I hope all is ok now. 
	    -Fix: Change '|' (pipe) to ' ' (space). '|' is halfspace in some CW keyers. Hamlib keyer can only full space ' '. 
						                (2.3.0(214)
16.03.2019
	    -Fix: CQmonitor decode 2 calls per line from Fox. From 2calls line decode does not allow reply with double click.
		  From 2calls line decode does not give myalert if qso is finished (MYCALL RR73)
	    -Fix: Removed several compiler (laz 2.0) warnings. Watch for bugs in calling external routines! 
						                (2.3.0(213)
06.03.2019
	    -rewite of CWType and CWKeys code and their layouts. (DL7OAP & OH1KH)
	    -CWType help page updated
	    -Add: stop cw send by ESC when Hamlib keying in use, should now work with Icom and Kenwood rigs. Only IC7300 tested.
	    -Fix: CWKeys resizing
            -Add: MouseOver CWkeys and CWType Fkeys now shows CWmacro content.
	    -Add: Paste/Drop over CWType now sends text. 
	    -fix CWType: now works ok with all 3 modes. Delete works in word mode before block send is started.
	    -fix: CWtype: speed change affects NewQSO statusbar <--> NewQso cw speed change affects CWType speed selector.
	    -Add: CWType change of mode returns focus back to typing area (m.TMemo)
	    -Fix: Hamlib cw send delay. Removed space between command "b" and text to send. 
                   Space was interpreted as part of message text causing delay at start.

	  -fix for CQmonitor. If in qso, but no other decoded calls in band did not clear monitor at the start of new period.
						                (2.3.0(212)

21.02.2019
	  -Detect wsjt UDP message using "magic number" (otherwise decode fails if JS8 tires to use wsjt remote)
	  -fix for FollwedCall routine. Was not working at all.
						                (2.3.0(211)
19.02.2019
	  -Cq-monitor. Some fixes for callsign detecteting function. (DL7OAP & OH1KH)
	  -fix for FollwedCall saving
	  -Support for N1MM logger+. Select from NewQSO/File/Remote mode for n1mm logger. IP and PORT settings are
           in preferences/fldigi/wsjt section. Selecting this allows logging from wsjt or js8call using n1mm logger
           option (without having CQ-monitor). included LoTW export workaround that allows JS8 mode qso uploads.  (DL7OAP & OH1KH) 
						                (2.3.0(210)
05.02.2019
	  -Fixed bug in History printing of CQ-monitor
03.02.2019
	  - Wsjtx Cq-monitor/Map mode: Completely rewritten with Lazarus standard components. Does not use richmemo unit any more.
            Seems that slowly crowing cpu load is now away. This version can be compiled with Lazarus v2.0 rcXX
	    Should show up to user with very minimal changes. (if any).

            All credits of this change goes to Andreas, DL7OAP, who wrote whole monitor core again using stringGrid component.

	  -NewQSO: Buttons LoTW,eQSL, HamQth had very small effective click area with certain screen resolutions. Tried to fix that.
           Tnx info: Giuseppe - IK0DWJ
						                (2.3.0(209)
16.01.2019
	  - xplanet indexOutOfBounds fix (Andreas, DL7OAP)
  	  - still main achor fix. Scaling of window failed. Tnx info: Giuseppe IKÃ˜DWJ
						                (2.3.0(208)
06.01.2019
	  So I'm here again!
	  I should not continue with this devel. But it is so easy compared to starting a new one...

	- dropped vfo query away. Sends now only "fm" instead of "fmv". I can not see any harm for this.
          at least with icom rigs "v" gives just "not supported"-error.
	  Advise me if this breaks something with other rigs or cqrlog functions.
        - Some anchoring and layout fixes again (NewQSO)
						                (2.3.0(207)
04.01.2019
        Allow ^ passing CWType. In word mode ^AR sends now combined characters with hamlib keying/Icom rigs


28.12.2018
	This will be the last beta test version of this year. Maybe it is the last of them all! 
        This beta is too far from official release  and I have difficulties to keep track of all code changes and make
        them as pull requests later one by one (as requested by Petr).
        I have never learned to use Git properly, and it seems I never will.

        Now I have to consider what to do during next year. I cannot continue with this devel version any further.
        Everything have to be started from zero again, if I still want to keep this kind of devel alive.
	
        Perhaps it would be time to do something else instead. But time will show....
        Happy New year !

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Preferences: added "sub" checbox to NewQSO/show recent qsos for X days: "instead show QSOs B4 with logged call" that
      keeps old qsos visible after saved (logged) qso with call. NOTE: this is option for "X days" so both checboxes must be
      checked to show list of old qsos after logging. 
    - Layout/anchor fixes: NewQSO, QSO list, Worked Grids, CQ-monitor
						                (2.3.0(206)
20.12.2018
    - fixed typo in radiomemories edit label
    - DXCluster:default Backgroundcolor white. If lotw and eqsl is given, lotw will win (Andreas, DL7OAP)
    - UDP message buffer debugging layout fixed (monwsjtx.pas)
    - WSJTX: added Contest name and exchanges extract from UDP. Adds now "contestname=S:exchangeSent/R:exchangeReceived" to
      start of "Comment to qso" field. Keeps existing comment text as tailer.
						                (2.3.0(205)

    - Just TRXControl layout fix
						                (2.3.0(204)
11.12.2018
    - Radio frequency list add/modify. Added Delete All button.
    - NeWQso implemented Tuning (Ctrl-T) when using Hamlib keyer. Changes mode to AM, activates Ptt, set Ptt of, return pervious mode.
						                (2.3.0(203)
07.12.2018
    - QSO list PgUP/PgDN error [in 2.3.0-(002)] fix. (Code from Andreas, DL7OAP. Thanks !)
    - Fixed bug in radio memories adif-import.A simple typo caused freq and info mix by one step.(report by DO1YHJ, thanks!)
						                (2.3.0(202)
06.12.2018
    - Merged from master. Changes to Main (QSO list) not taken from master as it seems 2.3.0-(002) still has
      problems with it.
    - CQ-monitor: Remove angle brackets (wsjt-x v2.0 uses these) from callsigns. When in qso loc "<!!>" changed to *QSO"
    - My version number is now 201. (original (002) -> 1st devel release after that is 201)
						                (2.3.0(201)
20.11.2018
    - Added filter option NOT that reverses search. Calendar objects for date setting. .
						                (2.3.0(111)
23.11.2018
    - Fixed info field TRXControl below "Mwri"-button update/clr. 
    - Added wb4 (worked before) date check limit. It affects CQ-monitor colors and grid map's squares and summary.
      Read revised help included. index/Quick start/wsjtx interface. (so remember to install help files from zip!)
      Utility is rather poorly tested, so expecting to hear comments...
						                (2.3.0(110)
18.11.2018
    - Modified radio memories database. Running WILL ALTER DATABASE TABLE FREQMEM ADDING COLUMN INFO (Do your backups!)
      You can now add 25char description of radio memory. Logs are backward compatible, but opening log with 
      older cqrlog version and opening add/modify memory from TRXcontrol wipes out contents of info columns.
      Staring part if info string (5chrs) will show up in field under "M Wri" when pressing "M up", "M dn".
      If no info string exist field will show memory line number (M #) as before (see version 104).
    - added menu item "Open memory list" to TRXControl/Preferences. You can now open memory list window
      (withhout edit) and double click lines to set radio frequency. When this list is open you can do logging etc.
      that is not possible when "Add/Modify memories window is open. To close this window use "x" in top right of window.
      (See updated help "Operation/"TRXControl")   
    - added rectangular selection to Prferences/xplanet. (Code from Andreas, DL7OAP. Thanks !)
    - the new fix for qso list scrolling. It works like following: 
	When open the qsolist it starts always reading with Max 500 last qso lines (like before).
	When using arrow up and down or page up and down nothing happen, still using those Max 500 qsos.
	When you are using CTRL-END, CTRL-Home or you are switching over 500 with "page down" or "arrow down" then
	the whole log is loaded and shown in the qso list. After this switch the qsolist will remain to have 
	the whole log open. Of course you can close qsolist window and reopen it... then you start again with first 500 qsos.
	I think this will help people who have PC with small CPU and memory to be able to work with this, too.
	Because most of the time when I'm using the qsolist, I only want to see the last 20-50 qsos. There are only
	very few days I am searching in the whole log file. So cqrlog only loads the whole log, when some one wnts to
	scroll far down, or jumps with Ctrl-END to the end of the log.

    - just changed the changelog splash. You do not see difference unless you FIRST install new help files from zip.

23.10.2018
    - Test fix to qso list scrolling problem by Andreas , DL7OAP. This may fail with large logs BE WARNED!!
      I like to take this in to test as with my logs (<10000 qsos), as well as Andreas reported, this seems
      to work ok.
      We need more testers for this. if it fails I'll remove it from next test version.

    - TRXConrol "M Wri" now stores frequency with decimals
    - Closing TRXControl window does not close rig connection
    - CW keys macros added/changed, see help.
    - Help files fixed
						                (2.3.0(107)

    - Fixed satellite mode bug with frequency entered with comma, not dot as expected. Thanks to Andreas, DL7OAP
    - Added small explanation to help files (Quick start/NewQSO & Operation/NewQso(online logging))how to get
      satellite mode in use
						                (2.3.0(105)
25.09.2018
    - Merged from master.
    - TRXcontrol:  "M Wri" button text is now red to indicate wrte operation of thi button.
       A new field under "M Wri" indicates last pressed ("M up", "M dn") memory. "M x" where x refers 
      to line number in Add/Modify memory list.
      "M 0" (in red) indicates that there is no memory lines, "M x" (in blue) indicates the last line in
      Add/Modify memory list.
      NOTE!! Cqrlog TRXcontrol memories are categorized by mode (groups). CW, SSB(=AM+USB+LSB+FM), RTTY, 
             DATA(=PKTLSB+PKTUSB)[no mode selector for this but you may "M wri" it anyway]. 
             So do not wonder if you get "M 0" and think you should have entries in Add/Modify memory list.
						                (2.3.0(104)

    - Merged from master. This includes CD skimmer addition from DH2WQ
						                (2.3.0(103)
23.07.2018
    - Fixed contest qso adif export. Now states right if question is serial_nr or message.
    - Contest report delimiter is now | (pipe). It represents "halfspace" in CW macros, so macros will work 
      in same way as before. Just a half space shorter gaps in message (that may be good as used in contest).
    - ST(R)X_STRING (contest message) is now ended with . (dot) That shows up in log, but is removed when adif
      export is done. Dot is added at qso save phase, so it does not affect CW macros that are sended while qso
      is going on.
    - Supports now adif import with ST(R)X/_SRTING) tags. Cqrlog did read them before, but did not use them anywhere.
      Now they are added to RST field in same format as when using contest form. 
      Now you can transfer contest logs between 2 cqrlogs and also restoring backups (that are done with this version)
      will restore ccontest messages ok.
    - Opening preferences from QSO list (main form) will now open "visible colums" tab.
    - New debug feature: debug>=1 will show all as before, negative numbers will show just studied part's messages 
      (used -1 for adif export debugging, other negative numbers may now be used for other routine specified debugs)
    - Help files fixed
						                (2.3.0(102)
19.06.2018
    - Test binaries: numbering starts now from 2.3.0-101
    - Bugfix: Wsjt-x remote used nonexisting variable if CQ-monitor was closed.
    - sTx routines improved with bugfix. Stops Tx now also if answering initatated from wsjt-x main screen.
    - Fixed text: Auto backup: preferences/confirmation/help as it also can prevent accidental
      closing of cqrlog (not clearly documented before).
    - Help files fixed.

    - Wsjt-x Map and CQ-monitor: New selection "sTx" (Stop TX) this corrects the deficiency of 
      wsjt-x that it does not stop your TX if you answer to CQ using split frequency and the reply is
      not directed to you. Requires that answering is initiated by doubleclicking a line of CQ-monitor
      or Wsjt-x Map

    indicating that right period of possible answer is passed.
    This happens ONLY if "no history" is checked. If not, colors stay as they are.
    CQ-lines turning to silver gray does not disable double click answering property. It is just informative

   - StartConnectCommand  can now still be set with Ctrl-S and now also via preferences. Change can be
     done in either way.
   - DXCluster button "preferences"/dropdown-menu/preferences work in way that the tabDXCluster of
     preferences is open if preferences are called from DXCluster window.
   - TRXControl  has now dropdown-menu item "preferences". The tabTRXControl of preferences is open

   - New design of TRXContorl window. Power buttons can be shown/hide using dropdown menu "Settigs".
     Default is hidden.
 						                (2.2.0(108)  
30.01.2018
   - disabled DXCluster call alert when webcluster in in use. It does not work in current webcluster
     connection.
   - Added StartConnectCommand for telnet dxcluster. Type DXCluster command you want to use into
     DXCluster's "command:"-line, but not send it to cluster. Instead press Ctrl-S to save the
     command as StartConnectionCommand.
     You do not have to be connected to DXCluster while doing this, but it works also when
     you are connected.
     The command will be sent to DXCluster when connection is established and DXCluster prompt
     received for first time for now on.
     Command is cleared by pressing Ctrl-S when "command"-line is empty.
   - Corresponding help files updated.

23.01.2018
   - added also old_call:='' to saveremoteqso to be sure cqs_dxcc keeps false.
								(2.2.0(103)  
   - added wsjt-x logging the start and end times. Previously the end time was used for start and
     end time as UDP msg#5(logging) did implement just only one date and time (@ 2015). Now Start time
     is added at the end of message and first time is used as end time.
     Both times are now logged correctly and because just one date in cqrlog the start date
     from wsjt-x is used.
								(2.2.0(104)  
22.01.2018
   - added "Run at cqrlog start" and "Run at cqrlog stop" calls to scripts ~/.config/cqrlog/start.sh
     ~/.config/cqrlog/stot.sh They are called when program is up/ges down and rigctld is running.
     You can do anything with them. At start switch on your coffee maker and when cqlog is closed
      switch coffee maker off  :D :D :D
     At stop phase 1000ms (1sec) time is waited letting script access to rigctld befor it goes down.
     This should be enough to execute a command.
     For powering rig via rigctld power command make start.sh like:
     ---------------------------------------------
     #!/bin/bash
     echo -n -e '\x87'1 |  nc localhost 4532
     exit
     ---------------------------------------------
     For stop.sh script copy start.sh and change 1 (after 87') to 0
     Remember to chmod a+x start.sh  (and stop.sh) to make them execute for all.
   - added PWR button to TRXControl window. State of rig power os not checked (as all rigs do not
     support it. At rig initialize butoon is activated and rigctld pwer on command is sent anyway.
     This should sync rig and button.     
   - fixed qso entry "qso_dxcc" state to FALSE when logging happens from remote fldigi, fldigi xmlrpc
     or wsjt-x. This was left TRUE for them all. When manual log entry is done it is set FALSE.
     Meaning of this it bit unknown, but if it is TRUE when editing qso and adding country prefix
     OH1KH -> SM/OH1KH the country info does not change (unless you focus field "state" and then
     focus some other field). Fix was to set old_adif:=adif before saving qso. Tnx Andreas DL7OAP.
   - fixed socket state error on fldigi xmlrpc. (did not work at all) Socket state was read after
     it was free'ed.

   - AlertCalls: alert calls still conflicts with wsjt remote. Actually with qrz/hamqth lookup done on background
     when alert calls form is open. Created one more query/transaction pair for alert calls use.
     Using that needs modification to refreshalertcalls (should not, but yes) query must be closed before refresh.
     When it was done with "common tr/query pair" did some other part close it as it worked without closing?
     If alert callsign list form is open and wsjtx remote running, the wsjtx-monitor lines will all turn black 
     after first transmit (after qrz/hamqth query).Colors come back on next decode after alert calls list is closed.
     Is ShowModal reason for this?

    - AlertCalls: alert calls had conflict (open query) using same transaction as worked gris/wsjtx monitor.
      Alert calls list disappeared always when wsjyt/wkd grids worked on background.

								(2.1.0(130))
02.11.2017
   - LoTW import wails on 630M. I think the  dutils.pas: function TdmUtils.FreqFromBand(band, mode: string): string; is missing 630M definition.
     Added that, but cannot test by my self.
   - CQ-monitor: Followed call line turns red after 15sec of receive (FT8,MSK144) otherwise after 60sec to indicate that valid reply period for
     this line is over.
								(2.1.0(129))

01.11.2017
   - WSJTX monitor: Added new feature "Follow". When "flw" is checked opens new part to bottom of window. Left editbox receives followed 
     callsing.
     Right side will show decoded line where that callsign is as originating (2nd) call and is NOT CQ or directed to YOUR CALL.
     Line has: timestamp, deltafreq, message text
     Status of checks and the call is saved over program restart. No alerts are connected to this line.
     The purpose of this line is to make easier to follow a DX (from all other deceded lines) who does not stay on permanent frequency,
     but jumps around answering callers.
   - Help files are updated. You should find similar things from internal help than from the CqrlogAdditions2.pdf
     (but only if you get folder src/help from my GitHub https://github.com/OH1KH/cqrlog-devel and overlay the help
     folder to your exisiting install. It is not added to test_binary.zip)

     directed CQ. (this does not fix all of them...never!)
								(2.1.0(127))

28.10.2017
   - WSJTX monitor: Addition to text-alert. Works as before text-in-text for complete monitor line, or looks just only callsign with 
     text-in-text, starts with (XY*) or ends with (*XY). One asterisk can be used at start or at end of search string to indicate start or end 
     search.
     Several comma separated search strings can be used at callsign search. OH*,*OH,A,B,C,*D

   - WSJTX monitor: Minor change to print out for extended cq direction.
								(2.1.0(125))

09.10.2017

   - Changelog: Added comment message about the test binary with request to read the accompanying documents.
   - DXCluster/Chat_RX window: Defaut size is now 2 (invisible). Resize it if you need it from button "Preferences/Chat size/[use slider]"
     Value will be saved with used log, so this affects only for first use ever.
								(2.1.0(122))

   - WSJTX Monitor:More specific print out for extended cq direction to help operator decide should he answer this cq or not.

   - DXCluster: Redirecting to Chat window uses now connection username (call) instead of log call that may be different than used
     to log to   DXCluster.

06.10.2017
   - Band Map: Copied setting "Show only active band" from Preferences to Band map filter settings. (As it really is 
     a filter). It is now in both places, but is easier and faster to change via Band Map Filter dialog.

   -NewQso: Bugfix "mode: Auto" checkbox state was not correctly returned after program restart.
								(2.1.0(121))

20.09.2017
   - CQ-monitor:  Country names (cut to length 15) are now displayed instead of callsign prefixes.
     Extended CQs (CQ DX, CQ AS, CQ AF .. etc) are now compared against own continent. If "CQ DX" caller
     callsign is from same continent as your call a "*" is added in front of country name and it is printed
     with "CQ ext" color defined.
     Same if "CQ AS" is called and your continent is not AS, and so on.
     If continent cannot be compaired (CQ extension is something special) same "*" and "CQ ext" color is used.
     This is to notify you to consider if answering follows good working practise and ham spirit rules.
   - "My Alert" is now compared oppsite way: First word of decoded line is compared against your cqrlog/
     preferences/station callsign. This should fit now also when you are using extended callsign XX/YOURCALL or
     YOURCALL/XX in your log as wsjt-x traffic uses always plain callsigns during qsos.
								(2.1.0(118))

   - more study with richmemo slowness when on for long time. This does not solve the original problem that
     exists (now 99% sure) at richmemo/lazarus code.
     Now CQ-monitor form is created at the time it is needed (opened), not at program start.
     When wsjt-remote is closed it will also distroy CQ-monitor form.(releases memory used by richmemo, too)
     Closing CQ-monitor while wsjt-remote stays still on does not distroy form.
     This way slowness (CPU load while richmemo printing) can be resolved without closing wsjtx & cqrlog.

     Just drop wsjt-remote off and start it again! Slowness (and CPUload) has gone !

     With this change richmemo slow printing changed so that lines are not slowly dropping. They appear fast,
     but time between wsjt-x decode end and lines appearing to CQ-monitor increases. It is harder to notice,
     but opening a terimal with "top -H -p $(pidof cqrlog) -d 0,2" you can easily find out when CPU load
     starts to stay >90% while decoding
								(2.1.0(117))

   - CQ-monitor now remembers showing state. I.E if closed while last wsjtxremote use will be closed on next
     program start and wsjtxremote initiate.

   - merged from Petr's master today. Imported own version of DXCluster (has DXChat) and CQ-monitor changes that
     has now send as pull request to master.
     Tjakomemo is now translated by Petr as TColorMemo.  (Nice!)

   - Wsjtx-decode: Bugfix that caused program failure if wsjt-x program was closed before wsjt-x remote
     mode was closed. Now closing wsjt-x program will close remote mode nicely as before.
								(2.1.0(112))

   - Manly for testing CQ-monitor slownes after long time on I added "noTxt" checkbox. It is usefull also for
     users who do not care about monitor texts, but like still to have alerts working. Checking this
     will skip richmemo updates, but keep other functions working.
   - Close Cq-monitor will not stop remote-wsjtx. This has been so in past, but changed it at some state.
     Now users who do not care CQ-monitoring and alerts can still log qsos and see qso data before logging.
     Cq-monitor can be opened again from main menu Window/Wsjtx monitor as long as remote mode is on.
								(2.1.0(113))

20.08.2017
   - CQ-monitor: Colors are now saved at the moment color selection menu closes. Should now be saved for sure!
   - Wsjtx decode: New: Now all UDP datagrams in buffer are handled in one go. After that
     timer waits 20ms (wHiSpeed) and if there are new datagrams they are handled in one go. This repeats
     as long as after 20ms there are still datagrams in buffer. If not, timer is set to 1500ms to wait for
     new period of decoding.
     This may stress slow computers, specially if wsjt-x is run at same hardware. Standard modern PCs
     should not have problems.
								(2.1.0(111))

19.08.2017
   - DXCluster chat: now sizeable. Click DXCluster/preferences-button and select "Chat size" from
     popUp menu. Bottom of DXCluster "command:" is changed to slider that sizes chat window.
     Move slider with mouse-left. Lifing up mouse left button saves current value and restores "Command:".
								(2.1.0(110))

18.08.2017
   - crash: When "no history" unchecked anf Cq-monitor get full scrolling and focusing last line kills
     program if they have enter/leave critical sections used in code. Without works ok.
     Left them away as useless anyway and changed scrolling so that it is checked after every newline added.
     Before it was "on memo change" action that , I think, triggered too often (every single item addition).
   - NewQSO wsjxdecode: Added "Wsjtxsock.WaitingData" before RcvPacket to buffer. Should now go to
     RcvPacket only if there is new datagram. Increased buffer size from 100 to 1000 (just in case).
   - Cq-monitor: can now streched to needed shape and size. Font (name and size, NOT style) can be changed
     from same popup menu as call/loc colors (right click monitor).
   - Again new SQL routines for Cq-monitor. Moved more work for SQLengine :)
								(2.1.0(109))

17.08.2017
    - UDP wsjtxtimer: Idle polling LoSpeed is now 1500ms all other modes except FT8 and MSK144 where 
      it is 500ms. When UDP packet is received turns to HiSpeed polling 20ms on all modes.
      When no more pakets returns back to LoSpeed.
      CQ-Monitor: Rewritten SQL routines. Dropped 7 queries from 9 ! Added CriticalSection.
      Now critical section is used every time richmemo is accessed.
								(2.1.0(108))

16.08.2017

    - Wsjtx CQ monitor: New color selections (more colors). Now also directed CQ (CQ DX, CQ NA ...) color
      can be selected.
    - DXChat: Completely new design. No buttons and settings. It is always there on top of DXspot list.
      I think I like this! Maybe scaling relative to DXspot memo would be nice...
      Done by "blind copy" of DXSpot memo (the way to use Tjakomeno without understanding a word of CZ :)
								(2.1.0(107))

15.08.2017

    - Wsjtx CQ monitor: Same color "coding" now affects to locators as callsigns. You are able to see
      "worked this band, but not current mode"(fuchsia, Upcase) and "worked on any other band/mode"
      (maroon, Upcase) in addition with previous "worked this bamd and mode"(lowcase, red) and 
      "not worked before"(Upcase, green).
      Change of qso colors chages also these locator colors same way.
    - Fixed database functions used for finding worked calls and locators.
    - DXChat is still in progress, at the moment hiding and showing is done ONLY via DXCluster window
      preferences/popup menu.
      DXChat now uses same font as DXCluster.
      OnTop and Hide are remembered (saved) over program restart.
								(2.1.0(106))

12.08.2017

    - WSJTX CQ monitor: Now green text is also bold
								(2.1.0(104))

    - WSJTX CQ monitor: User selectable colors. Right click on monitor form shows selection popup menu. 
      "Cancel" at selection popup menu hides color box in case of no new selection.
      Otherwise new selection changes color and hides color box.
    - "Stay on top" and "Hide" checkboxes for DXChat form. Hidden DXChat can be returned from DXCluster
      "preferences-popup menu/Show chat". Checkboxes are unchecked at program start (states not saved).
								(2.1.0(105))

10.08.2017

    - DXChat bugfix. Should work now forever(!?). Limit was 200chr by mistake. Scroll should happen @50 lines.
      Added Clear and Close buttons. Did not add "keep hide" chekbox as there is then no way to restore it.
      If it bothers you after 1st time it shows up drag it behind some other window and leave open.
      It will not take focus again until closed and reopen.
      Given up of font size adjust for now. It needs more study. (I would like to use jakoizmemo like DXCluster
      window does, but can not understand a single word of it;( )
                                                                      (2.1.0(102))  

    - Propagation DK0WCY and DXChat now follows common settings of preferences/fonts
                                                                     (2.1.0(103))            

09.08.2017

    - DXhat fixing. Buffer now 50 lines, should have same font and size as DXCluster (this needs testing as
      it seems that in my system it is not!).
      Adds now timestamp (your local PC time) before call to see when chat has come (if you are away).
      New version released, so my testing version subnumber starts from 101.    
      Added default frequency 5.351MHz to newQSO dropdown selection list (was missing).
                                                                                         (2.1.0(101))

28.07.2017

     - Added DXChat form. Shows up automaticly when connected to DXCluster (telnet) and received a line
       that starts "MYCall de " and line does not end to ">".
       Then line contains (hopefully) a chat line from someone and it is printed to DXChat form preventing
       it to disappear into flood of dx spots.
       "MYCall de " is stripped out so line contains just senders call and the message.
       Form shows up (and focuses) at first chat line but if it is left open it does not take focus when
       next chat lines are received. If form is closed (X) it will show up again on next chat line rcvd.
                                                                             (2.0.5(041))

27.07.2017

     - More informative CQ-monitor by colours of callsign.
       Red lowcase   = worked this band and mode
       Fuchsia upcase = worked this band, but not this mode
       Maroon upcase = worked on any other band and mode
       Green upcase  = never worked before on any band       
                                                                              (2.0.5.(040))
      
17.07.2017

     - Fixed timestamp at wsjt-decode from HH:MM to HHMMSS. This effects to CQ-monitor display and also
       makes "no history" selection work with modes where period is less than minute long.      
       Found out that double click on CQ-monitor line now initiates qso when FT8 is in use.
       Assume that it happens also with MSK144 as this fix is happened because new wsjtx version has 
       corrected UDP message.								(2.0.5.039)

     - As having continued problems with GitHub usage I have created a new repository "cqrlog-devel" that 
       has the latest version I'm using by my self.
       I'm not going to make any pull requests from that repository.
       The other of my repositories "cqrlog" is the one I'm using for pull requests, if any at all.
       Those will be manually merged from cqrlog-delvel, one-by-one (as requested by Petr) and I'm not going to
       add second before the first is accepted or rejected.
       Because of manual operation I can not gurantee that merged source works in way it works in "cqrlog.devel",
       Sorry, but playing with Git takes too much time, fails too often (becaude of misunderstandings of mine)
       and is harder to learn than programming languages.
       If you want properly tested version (from daily use as testing) look from "cqrlog.devel"

30.06.2017

    -Added JT4 and FT8 to mode list.
    -Added FT8 mode letter to CQ-monitor.
      FT8 is a new wsjt-x fast mode (15sec period) for HF and VHF working. It is not released as beta yet,
      but can be found as devel version from wsjt-x svn.
      There are known bug in UDP messages that adds one extra space. It is ame as with MSK144 and CQ-montor
      can fix this, but reply for call from cq-monitor does not work before bug is fixed. That will be
      checked when official beta of wsjt-x is released (no mind to correct it to cqrlog before that).
                                                                                     (2.05.(038))

08.06.2017

    -Wsjtx Cq monitor: 
 	- Added JT4 and QRA64 mode letters.
	- Added checkbox "ALL" to "MyAlert" (as option). Alerts all lines decoded that begin with MyCall.
          Often now you get directly report as answer to your CQ. Even the R-report, that is not correct.
          Checking ALL together with MyAlert you will get alert also from report, RRR and 73-lines.
	  Without ALL checked you get alert just if your call is first on line and valid locator as last on line,
          that is the protocol specified way to answer to CQ.       (2.05.(037))

15.05.2017

    -Fixed bug in Contest form that left reports sent/rcvd 599 when modes SSB,AM,FM because getting them wrong from
     NewQSO form after it's ClearAll. Now cuts reports to have only 2 first numbers (usually 59) when focus
     exits from edtCall-field of Contest form.
    -Added "Allow regular expressions" checkbox to "Alert Calls"-form. Works in parallel with preferences/DXCluster
     corresponding checkbox. (No need to open preferences for change of that)           (2.05.(036))    

27.04.2017

    -Added new parameter "Drop after SyncErr >" to preferences / fldigi. This automates remote mode closing when fldigi is closed. But as it
     may affect also (in slow PCs) when fldigi is started by cqrlog it is user defineable. 0 disables it and 1-20 means timer rounds until drop
     the remote mode. Timer round period is adjustable with "Try to load QSO from fldigi"-parameter.
     When remote mode close happens by Sync error limit it leaves to NewQSO field "Comment QSO" text "Socket error, check fldigi!" (2.0.5(035))

26.04.2017

    -Added alternative fldigi remote using XmlRpc. Allows fldigi to run on other networked PC than cqrlog. For more details see: CqrlogAdditions2.pdf
    -fixed some minor bugs on remote/frequency selection. (2.0.5(034))

23.04.2017

   - Changed Wsjtx decoding timer so that when UDP packets are available timer turns to HiSpeed (50ms, const value). When no more
     Packets it turns to LoSpeed (1000ms).
     This helps in situation where wsjt-x has been on band for long and then carlog/remote wsjt-x is turned on. At that point wsjt-x
     will send all of it's buffered decodings at one go and there may be lots of old lines.
     It also speeds up things during noraml decode period (secs 50 - 60 of minute) giving user more time to decide to whos CQ he
     is going to answer.
     Merged also latest changes from Master_ok2cqr                   (2.0.5(032))

   - Small bugfix. tmrWsjtx was enabled after disableremotemode was called causing program exeption when wsjt-x was closed before cqrlog.
     (2.0.5(033))

22.04.2017

   - Fixed CQ Monitor so that it now shows also MSK144 cqs. Double click on callsign line does not initiate reply as it does with JT65/JT9
     I do not know should it with MSK144 mode, but I investigate it more in future and fix it if UDP specs have reply allowed when using MSK144.
     (2.0.5(31))
													(2.0.5(029))
20.04.2017

  - Changed contest form so that pressing 1xESC will return cursor to the end of previously typed callsign fro fixing. It also
    stops CW keying if it is initiated (as it does on NewQSO).
    New log seek (+qrz seek) is done again when leaving call field (tnx. note LA2FDA) 
    2xESC returns also to call field, but clears previously typed callsign completely (as it does in NewQso).
    This form is causing some focusing conflicts with NewQso form, but seems to work anyhow.
    Needs attention of better skilled programmer.   (2.0.5.(030))

11.04.2017

  - Added IP address field to preferences/fldigi-wsjtx settings of wsjt-x. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) but can be changed.
    There is no valid IP format check so you have to type right formatted address.
    This setting can be used if you run wsjt-x on different computer than cqrlog. If so, put the IP address of cqrlog computer
    to Wsjt-x's settings/reporting replacing there the default 127.0.0.1
    At cqrlog computer put cqrlog/preferences/wsjtx-settings IP address to the same as it's own network IP address. No need to change
    port numbers. Remember to open your firewalls on both computers to allow UDP traffic from 2237 port on your network.
    Tested with two laptops on same WiFi local network:
       cqrlog PC ip address 192.168.60.222, cqrlog setting/wsjt-x:  port 2237 address 192.168.60.222
       wsjt-x PC ip address 192.168.60.223, wstt-x setting/reporting  port 2237 address 192.168.60.222 

3.4.2017

 - returned Contest/Msg is Loc checkbox function to original meaning, I.E. when checked Msg is expected to be locator and placed 
   now ONLY to New/QSO/Grid field (not together with received rst).
 - added Contest/Tru checkbox for true reports exchange. Changes tabulation order so that it goes RSTs, RSTr, NRr, MSGr.
   This might be useful in VHF, UHF, SHF Tropo, Es etc. openings (and maybe some contests, too) where you like fast qso logging.

 - Added DXCluster additions.
  -- ACalls toggle button does just the same as "Preferences/DXCluster/List of callsigns" I.E. opens alert calls list for edit:
     This is easier and faster than using it via preferences. When edit list is closed alert remains active (button text is green)
     Second press deactivates alert (button text is black).
     Checkbox "Inc" changes alert to RegExp,so if any part of alert calls list fits to dx cluster's call it alerts.
     Unchecked call must be exactly same. I.E. "Inc" checked with list call OF100FI alerts OF100FI/1, OF100FI/2 ..etc.
  -- Typed command history. With Ctrl-Z you can scroll back 5 last commands (fix, if needed) and reuse them. (2.0.5(028))

1.4.2017

 - added "No" checkbox to contest form. Changes tabulation order of  NRr,MSGr to MSGr,NRr for contest where there is just message
   but no number. Note that you can feed only numbers to NRs and NRr fields.
 
1.4.2017

 - added "No" checkbox to contest form. Changes tabulation order of  NRr,MSGr to MSGr,NRr for contest where there is just message
   but no number. Note that you can feed only numbers to NRs and NRr fields.
 
22.3.2017

 - modified NewQSO/Window listing to alpabethical order
 - added two selections "Reminder" and "Contest" and made forms and units for them. See CqrlogAdditions2.pdf for details.
   Tried to minimize changes to original cqrlog source code by doing these as separate units, but some modifications must 
   done inside original cqrlog source code to make these new ones to work.
   
   At same time I was thinking about moving wsjt-x decode inside of Wsjt-x monitor unit. It actually should be there.
   (maybe some day, maybe not...).

20.3.2017

 - Worked locator grid's selections "follow rig" and "show wkd only" are remembered over program restart.
 - Wsjtx Monitor selection "no history" and all alerting settings are remembered over program restart.
 - tmrWsjtx.Interval is decreased to 150ms. Affects UDP packet decoding.
   There is a situation where more speed is needed most:
   If monitor is started when wsjt-x itself has been running long time before it will send all decoded packets that are in 
   receive buffer (I.E. contets of "Band Activity" window of wsjt-x) during answer to ststus request wsjtx monitor is asking 
   to know what band and mode is in use.
   This also speeds up normal period decoding giving user more time (from that 10sec gap between periods) to decide to whose
   CQ call he is going to answer.

16.3.2017

 - Stupid programmer makes stupid errors. All fuzz with directed CQ call was because part of code was inside debug execption.
   So it worked every time when run inside lazarus, or if started from terminal with debug=1. Fixed and should be ok now.

 - Fixed state of newQSO/Mode-AUTO selection return in case where program was closed with CQ monitor (wsjt-x remote) left on.
   Now returns previous state on next start when wsjt-x remote is not yet activated. We will not save remote mode over program
   restart.(2.0.5(023))
  

15.3.2017

 - Added CQ monitor a function where asterisk *  is added CQ callers country code and printed in Fuchsia.
   This is to indicate that caller is calling directed CQ (DX, EU, AS, AF, OC, NA, SA etc.) and user should check that he is in dircected area
   before making answer to call.
   I.E. To answer 'CQ DX' you must be in DIFFERENT CONTINENT than caller.(2.0.5(020))

 - small bugfix (2.0.5(021))

 - seem to be hard to do... Addition to CQ monitor(2.0.5(020)) works when run inside lazarus, but not run from executive ?????
   lets see if this finally works. Otherwise "Houston we have problem..."(2.0.5(022))
   

14.3.2017
 - Returned (somehow, at some master version lost) function where disbling wsjt-x remote mode returns state of newQSO/Mode-AUTO selection.
   All needed code was there, but restoring part was removed from source(??).

   NOTE! This exist in original 2.0.4 too, I think ! (as I have not modified fMain.pas at this point when doing additions)
   
 - Merged upstream/master. Version change 2.0.5, within brackets still my build version (2.0.5(019))
 
13.3.2017
 - Added two missing files fwkd.lrs and richmemo/richmemopackage.lrs that git has left out from transfer. Without them fetched
   source from github to fresh computer did not compile cqrlog.
   
   Also tested how to handle richmemo. With these it compiled ok:
   Then main screen of lazarus select "Package". From that menu select "Open package (.lpk)"
   With file browser dialog find richmemopackage.lpk from richmemo folder and select it.
   Package dialog opens.
   Try to compile with button "compile". If it goes ok, (now should with all files) Press "Use" button and select "Add to procect".
   
   Now cqrlog should compile ok. (Note! Terms of lazarus menus are translated from Finnish to English. I do not know original terms)  

 - Found bug in fMain.pas that allowed QSO edit while in wsjt-x remote causing error "Cannot focus disabled or invisible window".
   Now fixed and asks now to close remote mode before editing (as fldigi remote does, too).


11.3.2017
 - removed "clearall" from wsjtx decode #5(logging) I think this losts qrz data. (altough it does not at v1.9.0!) (2.0.4(013))
 - Fixed #5 logging so that it does change edtcall (no refetch from web) if it is same as decoded call.
 - Fixed #5 logging so that if QRz locator is 6 char and the beginning is same as qsl locator the QRZ locator is keeped.(2.0.4(014))
 - Fixed small error in locator compare (2.0.4(015))
 - merged Petr's "sort by gridsqr" & "deleting comment" (2.0.4(016))
 - Fixed decode #2 (wsjtx status) so that if call does not change new QRZ fetch is not done. So you may add your own notes to NewQSO
   fields and they should remain there during #5( wsjtx logging) (2.0.4(017))
   

10.3.2017 started  to move additions from 1.9.0


 -You may find some help from this file. It is for 1.9.0 version and has "too much" for this 2.0.4
  http://www.saunalahti.fi/sakny/CqrlogAdditions.pdf

 -moved wsjtx cq monitor
  
  If you want to start qso by double clicking callsign at wsjt-x CQ monitor you have to set
  "Accept UDP requests" in tab "Reporting" at wsjt-x's configuration settings.
 
  Monitor has alert function. For that you need to make script that can do almost anything for alerting! 
  
  Setting audio alert play.
  You need separate soundcard for wsjt-x and other for alerts. 1st might be inside
  the PC 2nd may be your inside your rig or some kind of UBB sound card (ham digi interface).

  Move voice_alert.sh and wav files to ~/.config/cqrlog/voice_keyer  directory
  Make sure you have 'aplay' installed.
  Otherwise modify  voice_alert.sh to start your favorite player.
  
  ----------- voice_alert.sh -----start-------------------------
  #!/bin/bash
  # //audio file name (prefix) played on alert
  # //1.st parameter can be:
  #          'my'= answer to my cq,
  # //       'loc'=new main grid,
  # //       'text'=text found from line Ex. 'w c' on text field fits to "New country"
  # //       'call'=callsign found
  # // create files you want to be played

  # This scirpt is seeking names with '.wav' suffix! Change if needed    

  #select audio card(if needed) and play alert message
  
  aplay ~/.config/cqrlog/voice_keyer/$1.wav
  ----------- voice_alert.sh -----end-------------------------

 
 -moved worked locators
 -moved propagation and renamed it to prop_DK0WCY to keep also original propagation

  --fixed CQmonitor alert. Triggers now only once per decoding round, not every line.
  --added modes qra64,iscat and msk144 to dUtils (now 42 modes)
 -moved CW keys because of PgUP/PgDN buttons are handy
  --messed up ac-list of offical propagation while adding dk0wcy. Fixed
  --dk0wxy and worked grids now keep their open/close status and positions during restart 
 -Worked_grids mode selector now fills selection list from dUtils.cmbMode
